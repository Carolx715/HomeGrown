# HomeGrown

## Inspiration

With the whole world on lockdown due to the COVID-19 crisis, more and more people are adapting to their new routine of life at home. However, with the sharp decline of customers, many local businesses are struggling to adapt. Businessowners are faced a difficult choice: stay open for their communities at risk of bankruptcy, or shut down permanently. 

HomeGrown is our solution to this: a webapp that serves as a platform for small and local businesses to promote themselves to their communities and to connect with locally available financial aid resources. When customers looking for local businesses visit the site, it will display the businesses near them, and the customer will be able to search and filter the results based on the business name and the services they offer.

HomeGrown was made with React.JS and Firebase, and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Contributions

This project was made during the 2020 Hack3 Virtual Hackathon.

Team members:
Krish Mehta, Carol Xu, Rahul Aggarwal, Jeannie Quach

## How We Built It
We began with splitting the team into backend and frontend developers based on prior experience. The frontend team began with designing ideas for the overall layout and eventual functionality of the website, and the backend team gave feedback on these design ideas and determined the APIs needed to implement the desired functionality.

## Challenges


## Accomplishments


## What's Next?

* Turning the webapp into a phone app: deployment to iOS and Android.
* Adding more businesses and locations to HomeGrown's database, eventually expanding to small businesses in cities all around the world!
