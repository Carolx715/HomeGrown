# HomeGrown

## Inspiration

With the whole world on lockdown due to the COVID-19 crisis, more and more people are adapting to a new routine of life at home. However, with a sharp decline of customers, many local businesses are still struggling to adapt to this new world. Many businessowners are faced a difficult choice: stay open for their communities at risk of bankruptcy, or shut down permanently.

HomeGrown is our solution to tackle this problem. Homegrown is a webapp that serves as a platform for small and local businesses to promote themselves to their communities and to connect with locally available financial aid resources. When customers looking for local businesses visit the site, it will display the businesses near them, and the customer will be able to search and filter the results based on the business name and the services they offer.

HomeGrown was made with React.JS and Firebase, and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Contributions

## How We Built It
We began with splitting the team into backend and frontend developers based on prior experience. The frontend team began with designing ideas for the overall layout and eventual functionality of the website, and the backend team gave feedback on these design ideas and determined the APIs needed to implement the desired functionality. The frontend team began coding the landing page and business listings page in static HTML, and eventually converted this to a React.JS webapp, while backend worked on using the Firebase API to perform user registration and authentication. Once this was done, the backend team moved on to integrating the Google Maps API into HomeGronw to determine user location and the frontend implemented a feature that would allow searching and filtering through all the business listings and job postings.
